# Wiredcraft Back-end Test Project

## What is this about?

This application let you make friends with people nearby, it has the following features:

- See people nearby  (location required)
- Follow someone you're interested in.
- Unfollow someone you're no longer interested.
- Update your profile.
- Sign in & sign up.

What is even cooler is that we let you see people nearby as guest!

## Online demo

I've set up a online demo at [http://15.165.161.56/index.html](http://15.165.161.56/index.html)

The following accounts are provided for demo, you can try to sign in with anyone of them or create your own:
- steve
- jerry
- alan
- james
- joshua
- richard

They share the same password `123456`.

## Tech stack

### First about backend

**Persistence**
- Database is MySQL 8.0.
- [Docker](https://docker.com/) is for quickly setting up database.
- [Flyway](https://flywaydb.org/documentation/getstarted/firststeps/maven) for database versioning.

**Web framework**
- [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot), provides nice auto configuration features.
- Spring Web, absolute must-have.
- [Spring Data JPA](https://spring.io/projects/spring-data-jpa), nice persistence power, requires minimum configuration.

**Authentication & Authorization**

We support modern JWT token authentication with HS265 algorithm for better security guarantee.

The secret and token expire time are configurable via `application.properties` file:

- `security.access-token.expire-hours` Token Expire Time in hours, default is 24 hours.
- `security.access-token.secret` Secret for HS265, default is I&PYEkqGenob9H$zdwm7$TH6D9i@w&rc

- [Spring Security](https://spring.io/projects/spring-security)
- [Auth0 JWT](https://github.com/auth0/java-jwt)

**API Docs**

- [SpringFox](https://springfox.github.io/springfox/)

### Then about frond-end

Instead of installing npm, I try to use HTML pages to write the frontend demo, keep myself concentrate on the backend part.

- [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) 
- [Element](https://element.eleme.cn/#/zh-CN)

## Design ideas & Implications

The requirements are somewhat discrete, so I decided to design and develop an application that meets these requirements,
more importantly it's actually usable!

### User Case 
[https://www.processon.com/view/link/6278d9fee0b34d0758685fb8](https://www.processon.com/view/link/6278d9fee0b34d0758685fb8)

### Model design

### Architecture design

### Challenges

#### a complete user auth strategy

This strategy used by this application is stateless JWT token based strategy.

1. First, user sign in with username and password.
2. If authenticated successfully, an access token will be issued with limit valid time.
3. Subsequent requests can be made with this access token until it becomes expired.

#### a complete logging strategy

We can implement a filter to intercept all requests and log them, luckily we don't have to do it from scratch.

Spring provides `AbstractRequestLoggingFilter` class, I can easily implement my logging strategy by simply extending it, 
and pass request message to SLJ4J.

#### followers/following list

We need a table X for storing this kind of relationship, noting who follows who.

```sql
create table people_relation
(
    id                   bigint   not null,
    current_account_id bigint   not null,
    created_at           datetime null,
    following_account_id  bigint   not null,
    constraint people_relation_pk
        primary key (id)
)
    comment 'store following and follower relationships between people.';
```

Find current user's followers:
```sql
select current_account_id from people_relation where following_account_id = ?
```

Find current user's following:
```sql
select following_account_id from people_relation where current_account_id = ?
```

#### return the nearby friends

the core algorithm is how to calculate the distance between two coordinates.

This algorithm is relatively common, can be found at: [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/365826/calculate-distance-between-2-gps-coordinates](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/365826/calculate-distance-between-2-gps-coordinates)

My implementation is `Coordinate`.


### Implications

The actual implementation may differ from the requirements.

## Running in local environment

### 0. Prerequisites

Please install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) first on your local machine, this is the only prerequisite.

### 1. Start MySQL

This application requires MySQL database for user data persistence.

You can quickly start a MySQL database instance by executing the following command:

```shell
docker run --name mysql-server -p3306:3306 -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD='?2bW$PlGaY@7JKU#xY' -e MYSQL_DATABASE=user_service -e MYSQL_USER=user_service -e MYSQL_PASSWORD='^Mdh2jsk6sh#k2$' -d mysql:8
```

The above command will start a MySQL 8.0 database instance, the instance infomation is as follows:

| Property      | Value              |
|---------------|--------------------|
| Version       | MySQL 8.0          |
| Host          | 127.0.0.1          |
| Port          | 3306               |
| Database name | user_service       |
| Username      | user_service       |
| Password      | ^Mdh2jsk6sh#k2$    |
| root Password | ?2bW$PlGaY@7JKU#xY |

Use following command to enter MySQL container to inspect MySQL status:

```shell
docker exec -it mysql-server /bin/bash
```

If there's any problem, you can check out MySQL running log by issuingï¼š

```shell
docker logs mysql-server
```

### 3. Boot Application

Please use your favorite IDE or Maven to boot this application.

### 4. API Docs

This API uses Swagger for API documentations, the docs is at [http://localhost/swagger-ui/index.html#/](http://localhost/swagger-ui/index.html#/)

### 5. Demo

For better experience, this application provides a small demo based on Vue.js & Element.io.

You are free to explore the demo on [http://localhost/index.html](http://localhost/index.html)

## Caveats & Security

**About Coordinates**
Most modern browser has a rich set of API, you get coordinates data by calling JS.

But it only works in HTTPS, therefor, for this demo, you have to input your coordinates manually.

**About security.**

1. It's typical a bad idea to store credential in VCS, again this is only for demo purpose.
2. HTTPS will be required for actual application.

**About Lombok**

IDEA CE version seems having issue with lombok, so it's not used in this application.
